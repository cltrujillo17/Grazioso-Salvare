# Grazioso-Salvare
Grazioso Salvare app is a software application that can work with existing data from the animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs.


## Portfolio Reflection

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
In this course, I focused on building a CRUD Python module in Project One and then connecting it to the dashboard in Project Two. By designing the module with clear function names, consistent formatting, and comments, the code became more readable and easier to debug. Breaking down the CRUD operations into separate functions also made it adaptable—if the database structure changes or a new collection is added, I can reuse the same framework with only minor adjustments. This modular approach saves time and effort in the long term. Beyond this project, I could apply the same CRUD module to other dashboards, APIs, or even mobile applications that need database access.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
I start by analyzing the requirements of the problem—in this case, Grazioso Salvare’s request for a dashboard that filters rescue animals by training status and breed. I then break the larger problem into smaller, solvable tasks, such as connecting to the database, building queries, and rendering results in the dashboard. Compared to earlier courses, this project required a deeper focus on both backend (MongoDB) and frontend (Dash) integration, which helped me see how the pieces connect. In the future, I would continue to use this strategy of requirements analysis, modular design, and incremental testing when creating databases and dashboards for other client requests.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?  
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by creating tools and systems that make organizations more efficient. In this project, I created a dashboard that allows Grazioso Salvare to quickly identify and filter animals that meet search and rescue criteria. Without such tools, they would spend much more time manually searching through large datasets. By automating this process, my work directly helps them make faster and better-informed decisions. More broadly, computer scientists add value by combining problem-solving skills with technical expertise to design solutions that impact businesses, communities, and even society at large.
